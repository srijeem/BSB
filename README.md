Pairwise Sequence Alignment using Dynamic Programming
This Python script implements pairwise sequence alignment using dynamic programming techniques. 
It supports three types of alignments: global, semiglobal, and local. The script can process sequences from a FASTA file and allows users to specify a substitution matrix and gap penalty for the alignment.
